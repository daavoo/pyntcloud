    """ Read a _raw binary_ file and store all possible elements in pandas DataFrame.

    If the shape of the array is known, it can be specified using `shape`. The
    first three columns are used for x, y and z.  Otherwise the binary file is
    assumed have row-major format, three columns are formed and used as x, y and
    z , respectively.

    NOTE: binary files that are not `raw` will not behave as expected. If they
    contain a header/footer with meta data, or were generated e.g. via Protobuf,
    then bahviour is also undefined.
